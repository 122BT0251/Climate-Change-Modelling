# Sentimental Analysis of climate change post
In this project two types of sentiment analyzer libraries - TextBlob and vaderSentiment have been used . with the help of these libraries sentiments of all the tweets are calculated.
I have also clean up text by removing all the URL's and Punctuation.
# Datasets
This dataset encompasses over 500 user comments collected from high performing posts on NASA's Facebook page dedicated to climate change. The comments , gathered from various posts between 2020 and 2023 , offer a diverse range of public opinions and sentiments about climate change and NASA's related activities.
# Objective of this project
The climate change modeling project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict and understand various aspects of climate change. This can include predicting temperature changes, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and other related phenomena. The project involves analyzing historical climate data, identifying trends, and making future projections to help in planning and mitigation efforts.
