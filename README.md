# Climate Change Modeling Machine Learning Projects
The climate change modeling project aims to devlop a machine learning model to predict and understand various aspects of climate change. This include predicting temperature changes,sea level rise, extreme weather events, and other related phenomena.I have analyzed historical climate data, identifying trends, and making future projections to help in planning and mitigation efforts.
# Datasets
This dataset encompasses over 500 user comments collected from high performing posts on NASA's Facebook page dedicated to climate change. The comments , gathered from various posts between 2020 and 2023 , offer a diverse range of public opinions and sentiments about climate change and NASA's related activities.
